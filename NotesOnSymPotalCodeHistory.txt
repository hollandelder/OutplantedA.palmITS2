Notes on SymPortal Analysis

To set up SymPortal on One's own computer if you have a Windows machine, install the Ubuntu for Windows.

Install this in the home or base directory. 

Follow the instructions for Setup in https://github.com/didillysquat/SymPortal_framework/wiki/0_3_18_19_SymPortal-setup (I will note any differences here).

Install Symportal in the home directory outside of the Ubuntu directory as well. Then install Conda in the Linux directory.

########## To activate and deactivate the Coda environment #########
#
#     $ conda activate symportal_env
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate

######### Activate the Conda environment using the following code:
	conda activate symportal_env

######### Load the raw reads and start analysis with metadata

./main.py --load /mnt/c/Users/elder/OneDrive/Documents/UniversitySouthernCa/CoralProjects/Apalm_TimeCourse/Processing/AmpliconSeq/ITS2/RawDataTake3/Take3_FASTQ_ITS2/AllRawForSymPortal --name loadrawreads --data_sheet /home/helder/outputsymportal/SymPortal_aplam_its2.xlsx 


######### Continue the analysis with this command and get the collapsed DIVs.

./main.py --analyse 6 --name firstanalysis

######### Get sequences ready for phyloseq #########

Change the sample names so that they are all in the format of "site_crossyear-crossnumber_individualnumber"
Make this consistent across the absolute abundance DIV sheet and the meta data sheet that you will put into phyloseq 

Import into phyloseq in R 
See Phyloseq_ITS2_Apalm.r to see remaining code.
